This repository contains a pandas practice assignment designed to strengthen Python programming skills for data analysis. The tasks involve handling datasets, manipulating data using pandas, and performing exploratory data analysis.

## Assignment Description

The assignment is divided into three parts:

### Part 1: Supermarket Purchase Data Analysis
We analyze purchase data from a supermarket in China using the `Purchase_Data.csv` file. Key tasks include:
1. Reading the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

3. Performing various slicing operations using `.loc`.
4. Computing summary statistics like averages and max values.
5. Creating new columns based on existing ones.
6. Answering business questions, such as the number of unique products and the difference between the mean and median of total purchases.
7. Deleting columns and converting `datetime` data types for additional insights.

### Part 2: Titanic Passenger Data Analysis
This section focuses on demographic data from Titanic passengers. Tasks include:
1. Reading and exploring the dataset.
2. Renaming columns for clarity and setting new indexes.
3. Handling missing data in the `Age` column by calculating averages and replacing missing values.
4. Identifying key insights, such as the names of the oldest passengers and counting missing data.
