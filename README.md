# DEPI_Pandas_Practice
# Pandas-Assignment

This repository contains a pandas practice assignment designed to strengthen Python programming skills for data analysis. The tasks involve handling datasets, manipulating data using pandas, and performing exploratory data analysis.

## Assignment Description

The assignment is divided into three parts:

### Part 1: Supermarket Purchase Data Analysis
We analyze purchase data from a supermarket in China using the `Purchase_Data.csv` file. Key tasks include:
1. Reading the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Exploring the data with methods like `.head()` and attributes like `.dtypes`.
3. Performing various slicing operations using `.loc`.
4. Computing summary statistics like averages and max values.
5. Creating new columns based on existing ones.
6. Answering business questions, such as the number of unique products and the difference between the mean and median of total purchases.
7. Deleting columns and converting `datetime` data types for additional insights.

### Part 2: Titanic Passenger Data Analysis
This section focuses on demographic data from Titanic passengers. Tasks include:
1. Reading and exploring the dataset.
2. Renaming columns for clarity and setting new indexes.
3. Handling missing data in the `Age` column by calculating averages and replacing missing values.
4. Identifying key insights, such as the names of the oldest passengers and counting missing data.

### Part 3: Combined Exercises
This section involves working with both datasets to practice advanced pandas operations. Tasks include:
1. Merging data from multiple datasets.
2. Performing group-by operations and aggregations.
3. Applying custom functions using `.apply()` or `.map()`.
4. Visualizing results using simple plotting tools in pandas or Matplotlib.
5. Answering combined business and demographic questions based on insights from both datasets.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Data Loading and Exploration**:  
  Techniques for reading CSV files, inspecting data types, and using methods like `.head()` and `.describe()` to understand the dataset.

- **Data Manipulation**:  
  Slicing rows and columns using `.loc`, computing statistics, and creating new columns based on existing data.

- **Handling Missing Data**:  
  Identifying and analyzing missing values, calculating averages, and using methods like `.fillna()` to address missing data.

- **Datetime Handling**:  
  Converting columns to datetime format and extracting meaningful insights such as the day of the week and month from timestamp data.

- **Advanced Indexing**:  
  Renaming columns for clarity, resetting indices while retaining data integrity, and performing data selection using specific indexing methods.
